            itâ€™s totally okay if you are not able to make it. At the end of the day, your quiz will help other classmates study as well!</p>
          <ul className='bold-list'> Are my quizzes public? </ul>
            <p className="demoo-title"> Yes, all quizzes are inherently public to allow other users access to study material.</p>

            questions in the quiz. Make sure to only include information you are okay to have potentially displayed for your peers. All information you upload
            will not be sent or sold to a third party!</p>
